Certified Software Verification Release License Agreement

1. Background: Certified software (Software) are software that have
   been formally verified with mechanized formal artifacts
   (Artifacts). The release of the verification, i.e., these artifacts
   created to conduct the formal verification (Verification), may
   consist of formal models, specifications, and auxiliary artifacts in
   human-readable source form (Source Artifacts), as well as formal
   proof and supporting artifacts in machine-checkable binary form
   (Binary Artifacts). Such release is necessary for the transparency
   of verification of certified software as well as the protection of
   the interests of the software certifier or artifacts owner
   (Provider). The release of the Software itself is not governed by
   this license and shall follow its separate release license
   agreement, if it exists. In the case the Software's release license
   agreement imposes greater restrictions than this license, the
   Artifacts, if released together with the Software itself, shall
   also follow those restrictions.

2. Grant: The Provider hereby grant you a revocable, non-exclusive,
   non-transferable, royalty-free and worldwide license (the
   "License") to use the Artifacts solely for educational, research,
   or evaluation purposes, in accordance with Paragraph 3 below and
   subject to the terms and conditions of this License Agreement (the
   "Agreement"). The License entitles you to use the Artifacts to
   validate the verification, conduct research or education, and to
   create Derivative Works solely for academic, non-commercial
   research endeavors of the Licensee (A "Derivative Work" is a work
   that is a modification of, enhancement to, derived from, or based
   upon the Source Artifacts; under no circumstance shall any
   modification of, enhancement to, or derivation from the Binary
   Artifacts be allowed).

3. Limitations on Use: The License is limited to non-commercial use.
   Non-commercial use relates only to educational, research, personal
   or evaluation purposes. Any other use is commercial use. You may
   not use the Artifacts in connection with any activities which
   purpose is to procure a commercial gain to you or others.

4. Limitations on Distribution: If you distribute the Artifacts or any
   Derivative Works of the Artifacts, you will distribute them under
   the same terms and conditions as in this License, and you will not
   grant other rights to the Artifacts or Derivative Works that are
   different from those provided by this License.

5. Ownership: The Artifacts and the accompanying documentation are
   licensed, not sold, to you. The Artifacts is a proprietary product
   of the Provider and is protected under copyright laws and
   international treaty revisions. The Provider retains all rights not
   specifically granted to you hereunder, including ownership of the
   Artifacts and all copyrights, trade secrets, or other intellectual
   property rights in the Artifacts and any accompanying information.

6. Publication Credit: You agree to acknowledge the Provider with
   appropriate citations in any publication or presentation containing
   research results obtained in whole or in part through the use of
   the Artifacts.

7. Term of License: The License is effective upon receipt by you of
   the Artifacts and shall continue until terminated. The License will
   terminate immediately without notice by the Provider if you fail to
   comply with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Upon
   termination of this License, you shall immediately discontinue all
   use of the Artifacts provided hereunder, and return to the Provider
   or destroy the original and all copies of all such Artifacts. All
   of your obligations under this Agreement shall survive the
   termination of the License.

   OBLIGATED TO SUPPORT OR ISSUE UPDATES TO THE ARTIFACTS.

9. Limitation on Liability: This Artifacts is provided free of charge
   and, accordingly, the Provider shall not be liable under any theory
   for any damages suffered by you or any user of the Artifacts. UNDER
   NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL PROVIDER BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER
   PERSON FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR
   CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
   LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER
   FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER ECONOMIC LOSS OR
   COMMERCIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THIS
   ARTIFACTS, EVEN IF PROVIDER SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE
   POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY THIRD-PARTY CLAIMS.

10. Disputes: The Parties agree to attempt to settle amicably any
   controversy or claim arising under this Agreement or a breach of
   this Agreement. Thereafter, both parties agree that all disputes
   between them arising out of or relating to this Agreement, shall be
